# MOST Study Elements
## Assessments (screening, baseline & follow-up interviews)
## Locator information with ongoing updates
## Intervention component activities (individual sessions; groups; technology)
## Condition-specific activities and data collection
## Need to monitor and drive completion of study activities (intervention and assessment) which include activities common to all participants as well as condition-specific activities
# REDCap Overview

This manual is not meant to replace extensive and excellent documentation of REDCap
	We will point to specific REDCap documentation

# Types of REDCap projects
## Longitudinal trial
## Longitudinal+Scheduling
# Ways to build a REDCap project
## Online designer
## Data Dictionary

# Events
## Record-specific events
## Days-offset
### Specifies the “ideal” time for an activity as well as a range during which the activity can be completed Defining Longitudinal Events (5 min)
### Each event can have one or more instruments Designating Instruments for Events (3 min)
### Events and instruments can be repeated in a longitudinal project Repeating Instruments and Events (33 min)

# Organization of study activities into “Arms”
## Arms are a way to pull together a collection of events
### Screening
### Baseline interview
### Randomization
### Each MOST study condition may have an arm devoted to it to facilitate events and data collection that are specific to the condition
### Follow-up interviews

# Calendar application and scheduling (Scheduling Module (7 min))
## Schedule for individuals in one place
## Based on series of events which apply to a specific record (individual participant), the calendar is populated with record-specific events
## The ideal time for an event can be changed to a time more convenient for the project and participant
## Calendar can be used to see what events are scheduled and to enter a data collection form associated with the scheduled event (e.g., if the scheduled event is a baseline interview, following the calendar link will open the baseline interview data collection forms).   

# Forms vs. Surveys for Data Collection
## Forms only when staff-only data entry (e.g., blood draw results)
## Surveys more flexible (not just staff entering data)

# Interview Items and Other Data Collection Fields
## Item types
## Branching (think skip patterns)
## Piping (putting the response from an earlier data collection element into the content of a later data collection element)
## Calculated fields
## Data validation (ensuring a date is in a specific format; ensuring a recorded value is an integer within a specified range)

# Reports
## Lists of collected fields for all or specific participants
## Has limitations

# Data Export
## Pulling REDCap data by API
## Data from smaller projects can be exported manually within REDCap too

# Things more easily done outside of REDCap
## Review intervention activity gaps
## Review follow-up interviewing gaps

# REDCap Development and Production Modes
## Development for building and testing the project
## Production for real data collection and project management

# REDCap is actively developed
## Need to be aware of new features and system changes which may impact aspects of your project
## New REDCap features may require changes to this manual over time

# Supplemental File: A MOST REDCap project providing a minimal example
## Screening and baseline interviews
## Locator
## Randomization to conditions
### Stratification factor
### Full factorial with two components, each with two levels (i.e., 4 study conditions)

# Fields related to intervention activities
## Activity
## Date
## Duration
## Staff

## First follow-up interview
## Second and final follow-up interview

* The idea for the example project is to illustrate how elements common in MOST studies are organized in REDCap. The example is intentionally minimal (only 4 conditions; a small number of items for each interview).
* The manual will include REDCap screenshots. The images below give an idea, but final version of images can zoom in more effectively on the most relevant content.
