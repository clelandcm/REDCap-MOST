Taking medications can be challenging. We want to ask you <u>how much</u> of your HIV medication you have taken in the past 6 weeks.

Please think about a scale that goes from 0, meaning you took none of your HIV medication in the past 6 weeks, to 100%, meaning you took every dose of your HIV medication as prescribed during this time.

We know people often have trouble taking their HIV medication 100% of the time, but may take it once in a while, more or less about half of the time, or they sometimes start and stop. Think about how much of time, overall, you took your HIV medication you took in the past 6 weeks.

vas_q3,baseline_interview,"Now we are going to ask you for your best guess about how much of this HIV medication you have taken in the last 3 or 4 weeks, if you took any at all. 

We will show you a scale that goes from 0 to 100.  

So to explain this scale, 0% means you have taken none of your doses of this HIV medication in the last 3 to 4 weeks, 50% means you have taken half of your doses, and 100% means you have taken every single dose of this HIV medication as prescribed in the last 3 to 4 weeks. You can choose the number along the scale. Just give us your best guess.

No matter their type of HIV medication regimen, many people find it hard to always take these medications, every day, as prescribed. For example:
- Some people are waiting to start their HIV medication regimen.
- Some people get busy and forget to carry their pills with them.
- Some people find it hard to take their pills according to the instructions, such as ""with food"" or ""every 8 hours."" 
- Some people feel the need to skip doses to avoid side effects or to just take a break from HIV medications that day.

We need to understand what people with HIV are really doing with their HIV medications. Please don't worry about telling us if you have not taken this HIV medication at all in the last 3 to 4 weeks, or if you did not take your HIV medication doses as prescribed. We need to know what is really happening in your life, not what you think we ""want to hear.""",slider,"Using this scale, how much [vas_q2] have you taken in the last 3 to 4 weeks?",0% | 50% | 100%,,number,,,,[vas_q1] = '1',y,RH,,,,visual_analogue_scale

fu_vas_q3,follow_up2_interview,"Now we are going to ask you for your best guess about how much of this HIV medication you have taken in the last 3 or 4 weeks, if you took any at all. 

We will show you a scale that goes from 0 to 100.  

So to explain this scale, 0% means you have taken none of your doses of this HIV medication in the last 3 to 4 weeks, 50% means you have taken half of your doses, and 100% means you have taken every single dose of this HIV medication as prescribed in the last 3 to 4 weeks. You can choose the number along the scale. Just give us your best guess.

No matter their type of HIV medication regimen, many people find it hard to always take these medications, every day, as prescribed. For example:
- Some people are waiting to start their HIV medication regimen.
- Some people get busy and forget to carry their pills with them.
- Some people find it hard to take their pills according to the instructions, such as ""with food"" or ""every 8 hours."" 
- Some people feel the need to skip doses to avoid side effects or to just take a break from HIV medications that day.

We need to understand what people with HIV are really doing with their HIV medications. Please don't worry about telling us if you have not taken this HIV medication at all in the last 3 to 4 weeks, or if you did not take your HIV medication doses as prescribed. We need to know what is really happening in your life, not what you think we ""want to hear.""

fu3_vas_q3,follow_up3_interview,"Now we are going to ask you for your best guess about how much of this HIV medication you have taken in the last 3 or 4 weeks, if you took any at all. 

We will show you a scale that goes from 0 to 100.  

So to explain this scale, 0% means you have taken none of your doses of this HIV medication in the last 3 to 4 weeks, 50% means you have taken half of your doses, and 100% means you have taken every single dose of this HIV medication as prescribed in the last 3 to 4 weeks. You can choose the number along the scale. Just give us your best guess.

No matter their type of HIV medication regimen, many people find it hard to always take these medications, every day, as prescribed. For example:
- Some people are waiting to start their HIV medication regimen.
- Some people get busy and forget to carry their pills with them.
- Some people find it hard to take their pills according to the instructions, such as ""with food"" or ""every 8 hours."" 
- Some people feel the need to skip doses to avoid side effects or to just take a break from HIV medications that day.

We need to understand what people with HIV are really doing with their HIV medications. Please don't worry about telling us if you have not taken this HIV medication at all in the last 3 to 4 weeks, or if you did not take your HIV medication doses as prescribed. We need to know what is really happening in your life, not what you think we ""want to hear.""

We will show you a scale that goes from 0 to 100.  

So to explain this scale, 0% means you have taken none of your doses of this HIV medication in the last 3 to 4 weeks, 50% means you have taken half of your doses, and 100% means you have taken every single dose of this HIV medication as prescribed in the last 3 to 4 weeks. You can choose the number along the scale. Just give us your best guess.

No matter their type of HIV medication regimen, many people find it hard to always take these medications, every day, as prescribed. For example:
- Some people are waiting to start their HIV medication regimen.
- Some people get busy and forget to carry their pills with them.
- Some people find it hard to take their pills according to the instructions, such as ""with food"" or ""every 8 hours."" 
- Some people feel the need to skip doses to avoid side effects or to just take a break from HIV medications that day.

We need to understand what people with HIV are really doing with their HIV medications. Please don't worry about telling us if you have not taken this HIV medication at all in the last 3 to 4 weeks, or if you did not take your HIV medication doses as prescribed.
